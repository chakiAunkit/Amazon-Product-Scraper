# Amazon-Product-Scraper
In this project I used BeautifulSoup along with selenium and Python to scrape product data from amazon. The user needs to run the main function and pass in the item name of which the user wants to scrape data. The program will return a csv file where all the product data will be stored. The scraped data are Product title, price, ratings out of 5, review count and URL.
